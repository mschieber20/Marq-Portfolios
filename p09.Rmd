title: "Positivty and Resilience"
---

###Goal: Positivity turned out to be the biggest predictor of my primary DV. I wanted to see whether there was a relationship between positivity and resilience.

###Product: Scatterplot

###Data: Study 2 data

###Interpretation: People who are more positive are also more resilient!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
data <- readr::read_csv("Data.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Resilience, y = Positivity)) +
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = data)+
  geom_jitter()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = "darkred", se = FALSE)+
  labs(title = "Is Resilience Related to Positivity", y = "Resilience" , x = "Number of Positive Aspects")
```
