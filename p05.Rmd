###Product: Three simple regressions.

###Data: Study 2 data from thesis.

###Interpretation: They are all significant predictors.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)
library(broom)
library(MASS)
```

```{r}
data <- readr::read_csv("Data.csv")
```

```{r Positivity}
m_Positivity = lm(TotalP ~ Positivity , data=data) 

summary(m_Positivity)
```

#Positivty is significant

```{r}
m_Optimism = lm(TotalP ~ Optimism, data=data) 

summary(m_Optimism)
```

#Optimism is Significant

```{r}
m_Extraversion = lm(TotalP ~ Extraversion, data=data) 

summary(m_Extraversion)
```

#Extraversion is significant
